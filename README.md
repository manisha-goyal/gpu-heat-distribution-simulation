# gpu-heat-distribution-simulation
A CUDA-based simulation to compute heat distribution across a 2D space with fixed boundary conditions. The program iteratively averages neighboring temperatures for interior points, comparing CPU and GPU performance. Includes analysis of grid size, thread configuration, and iteration effects on computational speedup.
